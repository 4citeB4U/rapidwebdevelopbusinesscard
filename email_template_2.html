<h3>📧 Email Template 2: Boost Your Local Artist Network</h3>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Let’s Help Local Artists Win — Free Platform + Store Partnership</p>
<p>Hello [Store Name] Team,</p>
<p>I’m launching a local-first, artist-owned web platform that gives musicians everything they need — sales tools, fan engagement, tour management, and real revenue — with no middlemen taking a cut.</p>
<p>Your store is a go-to destination for music creators. I’d love to provide you with a free flyer/poster to help inform the artists you serve about this opportunity.</p>
<p>No sales pitch. Just real tools and local empowerment. We offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ 100% ownership</li>
<li>✅ No monthly fees</li>
<li>✅ Local support and onboarding</li>
<li>✅ AI assistants to guide artists at every step</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’d be open to placing a flyer in your space, I’ll hand-deliver or email it to you immediately.</p>
<p>Thanks for supporting the future of independent music!</p>
<p>Best,<br/>Agent Lee<br/>📞 (414) 626-9992<br/>🖥️ rapidwebdevelop.com</p>
