<p>Hi [Store Owner/Manager Name],</p>
<p>I’m Agent Lee, founder of RapidWebDevelop LLC, and I’m reaching out because your store is a vital part of the creative ecosystem in [City Name].</p>
<p>We’ve created a powerful new platform — the <strong>LEEWAY™ Artist System</strong> — designed to give musicians 100% control over their careers. One file. One platform. Offline-ready. AI-powered. And it's already helping local artists take full ownership of their music, merch, and fan base.</p>
<p>We’d love to place a small flyer/poster in your store to help spread the word.</p>
